"Operation" here refers to one of the HTTP "methods".

One of:

POST
GET
PUT
DELETE


...and the more exotic ones:

OPTIONS
HEAD
PATCH
TRACE
In the HTTP protocol, you can communicate to each path using one (or more) of these "methods".

When building APIs, you normally use these specific HTTP methods to perform a specific action.

Normally you use:

POST: to create data.
GET: to read data.
PUT: to update data.
DELETE: to delete data.













You can also use the other operations:

@app.post()
@app.put()
@app.delete()
And the more exotic ones:

@app.options()
@app.head()
@app.patch()
@app.trace()










Recap
Import FastAPI.
Create an app instance.
Write a path operation decorator (like @app.get("/")).
Write a path operation function (like def root(): ... above).
Run the development server (like uvicorn main:app --reload).
